# Moose and Vamoose
#### A reimagining of Oregon Trail in JavaFX
#### by Joseph Crane, Mohammad F. Rad, Paul Gatto

This project constitutes the final term project in the CP2560 Advanced J2SE Programming course at the College of the North Atlantic, St. John's, NL, Canada.

This game is one of strategy, reaction time, and luck, wherein you drive a motor vehicle from east to west, across Newfoundland, while managing your driver health and remaining vigilant about the province's number one highway travel road hazard - moose!

## Features:
- Manage your player attributes
- Avoid the moose
- Open source

## How to Play:
You are about to drive across the island, east to west, and you must manage your attributes
    along the way as well as stay vigilant on the road, as moose may suddenly appear and you must not hit them.
    If your attributes hit their critical value or you collide with a moose: GAME OVER! 
1) Load the game application and click New Game on the main menu once you are ready to jump in, or
    click Load Game to resume at the last landmark, if you have previously saved the game.
2) If you have loaded a file, you will resume from the last landmark in which you saved the game; however
    If you have started a new game, then the game immediately begins, so pedal to the metal!
    Use the Speed Up, Slow Down, 50Km/h, and 100Km/h buttons to adjust your car's speed and set out on your trip from Home.
3) Avoid moose that appear on the road by clicking the Avoid button that appears when a moose is on the road in front of you.
4) Keep an eye on your attributes. You just left home, you're plenty rested and fed. But you've got a long drive ahead.
    If any attribute reaches its critical value: GAME OVER.
3) Never forget: driving 110Km/H or faster means burning more fuel and having less time to react to moose on the road. Be careful.
    Remain vigilant.

## Notes:
- The game was developed using JavaFx and JDK13 in the JetBrains IntelliJ IDE.
