Moose and Vamoose
A reimagining of Oregon Trail in JavaFX
by Joseph Crane, Mohammad F. Rad, Paul Gatto


This project constitutes the final exam project in the CP2560 Advanced J2SE Programming course at the College of the North Atlantic, St. John's, NL, Canada.
This game is one of strategy, reaction time, and luck, wherein you drive a motor vehicle from east to west, across Newfoundland, while managing your driver health and remaining vigilant about the province's number one highway travel road hazard - moose!


Features:
- Manage your player attributes
- Avoid the moose
- Open source

How to Play:
0) You are about to drive across the island, east to west, and you must manage your attributes
    along the way as well as stay vigilant on the road, as moose may suddenly appear that you must avoid.
    If your attributes hit their critical value or you hit a moose: GAME OVER!
1) Load the game application (filename.jar) and click New Game on the main menu once you are ready to jump in.
2) The game immediately begins, so pedal to the metal!
    Use the Speed Up and Slow Down buttons to adjust your car's speed and set out on your trip from Home.
3) Never forget: going faster means burning more fuel and having less time to react to moose on the road. Be careful.
    Moose are more likely to appear on the road in more remote stretches of road.
    You may see a road sign warning of heightened moose population in the area, however...
    moose can't read. Remain vigilant.

Notes:
- The game was developed using JavaFx and JDK13 in the JetBrains IntelliJ IDE.
